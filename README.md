# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
 Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

#Introduction
The aim of this project is to read data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and produce a new dataset where tidy data can be found and used for further analysis.

#Project Overview

The idea of this project is to get used with the process of collecting, work and clean a data set. For that, the following procedures were required:
1) a tidy data set;
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis;
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. Check this for aditional information.
